Identify employee attributes: Employee_ID, Name, Department, Job_Title, Manager_ID, Hire_Date, Salary.
Define relational schema: Employee (Employee_ID, Name, Department, Job_Title, Manager_ID, Hire_Date, Salary).
Determinefunctional dependencies(FDs)betweenattributes:
Employee_ID -> Name, Department, Job_Title, Manager_ID, Hire_Date, Salary
Department-> Manager_ID
Manager_ID-> Name


Step2: Convertto1NF


Eliminaterepeatinggroupsorarrays(none inthisexample).
Create separate tables for each repeating group (none in this example).


Step3: Convertto2NF


Ensureeach non-keyattributedependsontheentireprimary key.

Move non-key attributes to separate tables if they depend on only part of the primary key.
Create Department table: Department (Department_ID, Manager_ID, Name).
Create Employee table: Employee (Employee_ID, Name, Department_ID, Job_Title, Hire_Date, Salary).
OUTPUT:-
Employee(Employee_ID, Name, Department_ID, Job_Title, Hire_Date, Salary)
Department(Department_ID,Manager_ID,Name)


Step4: Convertto3NF

Move non-key attributes to separate tables if they depend on another non-key attribute.
CreateManagertable: Manager (Manager_ID, Name).
